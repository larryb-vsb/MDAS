Background

We are implementing an internal Line of Business (LOB) application (Merchant Data Warehouse) that generates system alerts and report notifications for internal staff.
To align with security, phishing prevention, and audit best practices, we need to establish a dedicated, trusted subdomain for all system generated email and enforce controlled mail flow through Microsoft 365.

________________________________________

Requested Configuration
1. Create Dedicated Application Mail Subdomain
Please assist with configuring the following application-only mail subdomain :
mdasmail.vermontstatebank.com
This subdomain will be used exclusively for automated system messages, not human mailboxes.
Example sender:
alerts@mdasmail.vermontstatebank.com

________________________________________
2. DNS Configuration (Subdomain Only)
Please configure and verify the following DNS records for dasmail.vermontstatebank.com:
SPF
•	Allow sending only via Microsoft 365
•	Hard fail on all others
DKIM
•	Enable DKIM signing in Microsoft 365 for the subdomain
•	Publish required CNAME records
DMARC
•	Enforce strict policy
•	Alignment set to strict
•	Policy set to reject
Target outcome:
•	Prevent spoofing
•	Protect primary domain reputation
•	Pass DMARC alignment for all legitimate messages

________________________________________

3. Exchange Online / M365 Mail Flow Controls
Please implement the following mail flow controls:
A. Inbound Connector
•	Connector that only allows mail claiming to be from dasmail.vermontstatebank.com if: 
o	It originates from approved internal relay IPs (app servers or SMTP relay)
o	TLS is enforced
B. Enforcement Rule
•	Mail flow rule to reject any message with sender domain
@mdasmail.vermontstatebank.com
unless it arrives via the approved connector
This ensures:
•	No spoofed or unauthorized system mail
•	Full control and auditability
________________________________________

4. Application Sending Model
The application will:
•	Send mail via internal SMTP relay (preferred)
•	Not send mail directly to the internet
•	Not use shared or human mailboxes
(Optional enhancement if available):
•	Microsoft Graph API with managed identity (future phase)
________________________________________

5. Security & Content Expectations (Informational)
For awareness, system-generated mail from this domain will:
•	Contain alert summaries and report notifications only
•	Include links back to authenticated internal systems
•	Not include customer data, merchant PII, or attachments
________________________________________

Validation & Deliverables Requested
Please confirm and provide:
1.	DNS records created/updated
2.	Connector and mail flow rule names
3.	DKIM and DMARC validation confirmation
4.	Test message headers showing: 
o	SPF = pass
o	DKIM = pass
o	DMARC = pass
