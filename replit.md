### Emergency Protocol Documentation
**Manual Batch Processing Method**:
```sql
UPDATE dev_tddf_raw_import 
SET processing_status = 'processed',
    processed_at = NOW(),
    skip_reason = 'manual_batch_processing_X'
WHERE processing_status = 'pending' 
  AND record_type IN ('DT', 'BH', 'P1')
  LIMIT [batch_size];
```

**Batch Size Guidelines**:
- Emergency processing: 1,000 records (maximum throughput)
- Standard switch processing: 500 records (optimized balance)

### ❌ CRITICAL PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED (July 26, 2025)
**Root Cause**: NODE_ENV environment variable not set in production deployment
- **Production Impact**: System defaults to development mode, displaying dev_ table data (42,028 records) instead of production data (34 records)
- **Environment Detection**: `NODE_ENV` is undefined/empty in production, causing fallback to 'development' mode
- **Table Routing Error**: Production frontend incorrectly queries dev_uploaded_files, dev_transactions, dev_tddf_records instead of production tables
- **Fix Required**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` in Replit deployment environment variables
- **Manual Configuration**: Production deployment needs environment variable configuration through Replit dashboard

## TDDF Record Type Processing Architecture

### Switch-Based Processing System
The TDDF processing system uses a centralized switch-based architecture for handling different record types. This design enables easy extension for new record types.

#### Core Processing Components
- **Primary Processing Method**: `processDTRecordWithClient()` in `server/storage.ts` handles DT (Detail Transaction) records
- **Switch Logic**: Located in TDDF processing pipeline, routes records by type identifier (positions 18-19 in TDDF specification)
- **Emergency Processing**: Scanly-Watcher includes Alex-style 4-phase emergency processing with switch-based logic

#### Current Record Types Implemented
- **DT Records**: Full field extraction with 127 database columns (positions 18-287+ from TDDF spec)
- **BH Records**: Batch Header processing (basic implementation)
- **P1 Records**: Purchasing Card Extension processing with `processP1RecordWithClient()` method
- **Other Types**: E1, G2, AD, P2, DR records (currently skipped but infrastructure ready)

#### Adding New Record Types - Implementation Pattern
To add a new record type (e.g., "A1" Authorization records):

1. **Database Schema**: Add new table in `shared/schema.ts` following existing pattern:
   ```typescript
   export const tddfA1Records = pgTable("dev_tddf_a1_records", {
     id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
     // Add fields based on TDDF specification positions
   });
   ```

2. **Processing Method**: Create dedicated processing method in `server/storage.ts`:
   ```typescript
   async processA1RecordWithClient(line: string, uploadId: string): Promise<void> {
     // Extract fields from TDDF positions per specification
     // Insert into tddf_a1_records table
   }
   ```

3. **Switch Logic Integration**: Add case to existing switch statement in TDDF processing:
   ```typescript
   case 'A1':
     await this.processA1RecordWithClient(line, uploadId);
     break;
   ```

4. **Emergency Processing**: Update Scanly-Watcher emergency processing phases to include A1 records in appropriate phase

#### Key Implementation Insights
- **Field Position Accuracy**: All field extractions must match exact TDDF specification positions (verified through multiple corrections)
- **Environment Awareness**: Use proper table prefixes (`dev_` for development, none for production)
- **Performance Optimization**: Switch-based processing handles 500-1000 records per batch efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Each record type needs proper validation and error logging
- **Raw Data Storage**: All record types store complete raw line data in `tddf_raw_import` table for reprocessing

#### Database Integration Pattern
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Each record type gets dedicated table with foreign key to upload source
- **Field Mapping**: Database column names use snake_case, extract using camelCase in processing
- **Index Creation**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields (upload_id, transaction_date, etc.)

#### Testing and Validation
- **Field Position Verification**: Use raw TDDF line analysis to confirm correct field extraction
- **Processing Rate Monitoring**: Scanly-Watcher tracks processing rates by record type
- **Emergency Recovery**: Proven 4-phase approach processes new record types during system recovery

#### Lessons Learned from Record Type Implementation

**From DT Records Implementation**:
- Field position accuracy is critical - multiple corrections needed (MCC Code 273-276, Terminal ID 277-284, Authorization Number 243-250)
- Database schema must match exact TDDF specification for data integrity
- Comprehensive field extraction required all 127 columns to avoid data loss

**From P1 Records Implementation**:
- Switch-based processing easily accommodates new record types with dedicated processing methods
- Emergency processing phases must include new record types to prevent backlog accumulation
- Each record type needs proper field position mapping from TDDF specification

**From BH Records Implementation**:
- Simple record types can be implemented with minimal fields initially
- Frontend display requires tab-based interface for different record types
- Color-coded visualization helps distinguish record types (DT-blue, BH-green, P1-orange)

**From System Emergency Processing**:
- Alex-style 4-phase emergency processing can handle any record type through switch logic
- Performance monitoring by record type enables granular processing analysis
- Manual SQL batch processing provides fallback for any record type during emergencies

#### Architecture Benefits for New Record Types
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Adding new record type requires only database schema, processing method, and switch case
- **Automatic Integration**: New record types inherit raw data storage, error handling, and monitoring capabilities
- **Scalable Performance**: Switch-based processing maintains performance regardless of record type complexity
- **Emergency Recovery**: Scanly-Watcher automatically includes new record types in emergency processing phases
